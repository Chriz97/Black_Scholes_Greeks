# Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing and Greeks Calculator

This repository contains a Python script that calculates the price of European Call and Put options, as well as the associated Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho). The calculations are based on the Black–Scholes–Merton model proposed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert C. Merton in their 1973 paper, "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities".

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy



## Output
The output will display:

- Option Price
- Delta: Sensitivity of option price to stock price change
- Gamma: Rate of change in delta for a change in stock price
- Theta: Sensitivity of option price to the passage of time
- Vega: Sensitivity of option price to changes in volatility
- Rho: Sensitivity of option price to changes in the risk-free rate

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the concept of Option Pricing and the Black-Scholes-Merton Model, and was created as part of a programming challenge to improve my Python skills. Thanks to the many resources available online for learning about finance, options and pricing.
